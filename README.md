# RemoteTCPControl

A Python-based client–server project that demonstrates remote control of a computer over TCP using a custom protocol.

⚠️ **Educational use only** – this project was built for learning purposes (networking, sockets, threading, and file transfer).

## 🚀 Features

The server allows a connected client to perform remote actions such as:

- Get server time
- Get server computer name
- Generate a random number
- Take a screenshot of the server machine
- Download files from the server
- List directory contents
- Delete files
- Copy files
- Execute programs on the server
- Gracefully close the connection

All communication is done over TCP using a custom message-size protocol.
